## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd mcp_firmware_agent
python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Access Web Interface
Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000/chat`

### 3. Try Sample Queries
- "How do I debug a hard fault?"
- "What are common causes of watchdog resets?"
- "Explain ARM Cortex-M exception handling"
- "How can I optimize my firmware for low power?"

### 4. Upload a Log File
- Use the file upload area in the web interface
- Or use the REST API endpoints programmatically

## üìö Example Conversations

### Stack Overflow Debugging
```
üë§ User: I'm getting a hard fault, how do I debug it?

ü§ñ Assistant: A hard fault typically indicates a serious system error. Here's how to debug it systematically:

1. **Check the Fault Status Registers**:
   - HFSR (Hard Fault Status Register)
   - CFSR (Configurable Fault Status Register)
   - MMFAR/BFAR for memory fault addresses

2. **Examine the Stack Frame**:
   - PC (Program Counter) shows where the fault occurred
   - LR (Link Register) shows the calling function
   - Stack pointer and registers at fault time

3. **Common Causes**:
   - Stack overflow (check stack usage)
   - NULL pointer dereference
   - Memory corruption
   - Invalid function pointers

Would you like me to help you analyze specific fault registers or do you have a crash log to examine?

Suggestions:
‚Ä¢ "How do I read the fault status registers?"
‚Ä¢ "What's the difference between hard fault and memory fault?"
‚Ä¢ "I have a crash log to analyze"
```

### Memory Corruption Analysis
```
üë§ User: [Uploads crash log]

ü§ñ Assistant: üìä **Analysis Complete** (Confidence: 95%)

**Summary:** Memory corruption detected in heap allocation at address 0x20008300. Buffer overflow in `process_sensor_data()` function overwriting heap metadata.

**Recommended Fix:** Add bounds checking in data processing functions and use safe string operations.

**Likely Module:** sensor_manager.c, lines 156-158

I can see this is a heap corruption issue. The log shows:
- Magic number verification failed at 0x20008300
- Heap block size inconsistency detected
- Stack trace points to sensor data processing

üí¨ **Ask me anything about this analysis!** For example:
‚Ä¢ "How can I prevent heap corruption?"
‚Ä¢ "What debugging tools can help detect this?"
‚Ä¢ "Are there patterns in when this occurs?"
```
